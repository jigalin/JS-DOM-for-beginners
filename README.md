# ðŸ“š Vanilla Javascript Beginners guide by JIGALIN

**Want to learn the basics of Javascript and prefer to read through code directly to understand how it works?**

Within this repo, you will find:
1. A small, functional app **(index.html & main.js)** which has a basic example of querying the DOM, creating variables, an event listener and loading new elements onto the page with VanillaJS. The purpose of this is to show in practice whats included in the notes section.
2. A **'VanillaJS_Cheatsheet.js'** which is a non-functional outline of all the useful elements of Vanilla javascript you should know to get into the basics of using JS. There are 12 sections, each with detailed commented notes.

<h2>Recommended for beginners, or those looking to brush up on their vanilla JS.</h2>
- Recommended for people who understand the basic programming paradigms, but are looking to learn JS.<br>
- Useful as a foundational starting point for going into programming with Typescript or using framewors like VueJs or ReactJs<br>
- No current planned future support or developments for this repo.<br>
- I used this as a technical practice and note-taking study for myself, and thought it may be useful for others!<br>
